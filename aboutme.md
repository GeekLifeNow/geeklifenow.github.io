_This is a story of a SysAdmin that is making a transition to the cloud:_

I started my professional career in IT in the summer of 2008 working as a general PC technician for a Christian school. I was a 5th grade elementary teach during the school year, but the finances did not allow me to take the summers off. So my first two summers I worked with the maintenance crew and then I got wise and requested to work with the Technology Department, which really just consisted on one person! 

From there I learned the ins and outs of PC repair, Windows Server domains, Imaging (Acronis True Image), desktop setups, and much more. I was extremely fortunate and blessed to work under a mentor that freely shared his wide breadth of knowledge with me and truly wanted to see me succeed. I am very thankful for these people that have come into my life in their seasons and I am actually in a role to start giving back to those working with me.

Lately, I've been focused on automation in my current environment and since it is 99% Windows, that means PowerShell!

_"Do you do anything besides work?"_

Oh yea! Once I put work away, I like to spend time with my family and create videos and assist my wife with her projects like dramas, dinner theatres, and our budding [YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4noLQPc1IgZlZMNf2uEYg){:target="_blank"}
